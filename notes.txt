To do
* Figure out exam dates (should be moved later)
* update outline
* Post updated intro and math notes
* Poll everywhere
* invite students
* Create channels
	* George tutorials
	* Steve tutorials
	* Maybe tutorial lectures (but we can set this up later if the team decides they're doing it)

Set up polls and review poll policy

Avenue announcements are still the gold standard for communication
* Is Avenue working? It says active
